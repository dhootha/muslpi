muslpi-cross
============

muslpi-cross is a cross lfs build system for raspberry pi (but can/will possibly
be extended to a generic cross lfs build system).

The resulting clfs will use the lightweight and posix-conformant musl libc, and
a bsd style init system.

This build system will first build a cross toolchain (toolchain/host packages)
and then build cross compiled core packages.


== Instruction ==

= First step =
First to simplify use of this build system, it is recommended to add tools
directory to your PATH in order to run build scripts directly :

	export PATH=${PWD}/tools:${PATH}
or
	setenv PATH ${PWD}/tools:${PATH}

The next part will suppose that PATH env variable has been set accordingly if
not you have to prefix calls to build.sh, install.sh and uninstall.sh with
path to tools directory


= Build a package =
In order to build a package, go to the package directory and run build.sh,
this will build a tar.gz-based package

As footprints have not been well tested on different environment you can use
"build.sh -f" to not check package footprint.


= Install a package =
Run install.sh <pkg.tar.gz>


= Uninstall a package =
To uninstall a cross package use "uninstall.sh pkg" and to uninstall a host
package use "uninstall.sh pkg host"


= Auto build =
Lazy people can use install_pkglist.sh to automatically build a package list.
You can find two usefull package lists in config/pkg_lists directory. For
example to make a complete install run these two commands :

install_pkglist.sh config/pkg_lists/toolchain
install_pkglist.sh config/pkg_lists/core

And go take a beer and 6 others because ths will take a long long time.

You can use "install_pkglist.sh -f" if you want to bypass package footprint
checking.


= configure =
You can play with some build options by modifying files in config/


= Result =
Toolchain and clfs result will be placed in build directory. When done you can
dd the clfs dir in a well formatted disk, add a /etc/fstab file and boot up your
raspberry pi. If you get lucky this possibly can boot sometime.
