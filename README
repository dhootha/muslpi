muslpi-cross
============

muslpi-cross is a cross lfs build system for raspberry pi (but can/will possibly
be extended to a generic cross lfs build system).

The resulting clfs will use the lightweight and posix-conformant musl libc, a
bsd style init system.

This build system will first build a cross toolchain (toolchain/host packages)
and then build cross compiled core package.


== Instruction ==

= Build a package =
In order to build a package, go to the package directory and run ../../build.sh,
this will build a tar.gz-based package

= Install a package =
Run ../../install.sh <pkg.tar.gz>

= Uninstall a package =
To uninstall a cross package use "uninstall.sh pkg" and to uninstall a host
package use "uninstall.sh pkg host"
